/**
 * The filesystem source plugin lets you query data about files, but it doesnâ€™t let you
 * use the data inside the files themselves.
 *
 * To make this possible, Gatsby supports transformer plugins, which take the raw content from
 * source plugins and transform it into something more usable.
 *
 * e.g. gatsby-plugin-mdx
 *
 * This plugin allows use of MDX, a file format that allows Markdown and JSX alongside your text
 * content.
